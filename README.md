# access-jwt

Example Cloudflare worker to decode and validate [Cloudflare Access JWT tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/validating-json).

Depends on [@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt](https://github.com/tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt)

[The code](https://github.com/jldec/access-jwt/blob/main/src/index.js#L10-L43) fetches public keys from `https://${env.ACCESS_TEAM_NAME}.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/certs`. Your team name can be found in the Custom Pages settings of the Cloudflare [Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com).

To avoid making a fetch request on the certs endpoint for every JWT validation, public keys are cached in a worker secret CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_PUBLIC_KEYS. A query parameter of `f=1` will force this value to be refreshed. (TODO force a refresh with a weekly cron worker)

By decoding the JWT from the `CF_Authorization` cookie instead of relying on the `cf-access-jwt-assertion` header, you can continue identifying authenticated users even for un-authed routes on the same origin, once they have logged in. This works because the cookie is scoped to the hostname unless you explicitly configure Access to scope the cookie to the application path.

[Alternative implementation](https://gist.github.com/eidam/7fb298196a43b2c172245219c6dd7da1) using [hono](https://hono.dev/) middleware and [jose](https://github.com/panva/jose).

### To deploy on your own Cloudflare Access protected endpoint
- Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm ship`
  (using 'ship' instead of 'deploy' allows 'pnpm ship' without 'run')
- Set the necessary secrets using `pnpm wrangler secret put <SECRET_NAME>`
  See wrangler.toml for details.
- Configure the deployed worker to trigger on your endpoint.
- Open the endpoint and authenticate with your browser.

### Possible improvements
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Mock jwt and keys for local use
